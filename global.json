Hello Adam, I hope you are doing well.  I don't know if you remember me,
but I worked for you on a project at Moser Consulting in 2015 and 2016.  
I am interested in getting re-acquainted with certain people from my past, and I am interested in learning about the projects that you have been working on.  Are you potentially available for a 10-20 minute informational interview at any point, at your convenience?  I am completely fine with it being virtual, and if you were
more interested in a coffee or lunch chat, I would go for that as well.  If so,
anywhere and anytime convenient for you is perfectly fine by me.  Either way,
if you think you have time at any point, I would like to get re-acquainted with
you.....thank you for your time!!
